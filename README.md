## Introduction
This project utilizes the EfficientNetB5 architecture to classify various skin diseases. The model is known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling image classification tasks.

## Objective
The main goal is to develop a high-precision model capable of accurately classifying skin diseases from dermatoscopic images, with an emphasis on achieving an F1 score of 83%.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises dermatoscopic images categorized into several common skin diseases. Each image is annotated with a specific disease label. The source of the dataset, its size, and the number of categories should be detailed here.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
Describe the steps taken to prepare the data for training, including any augmentation techniques, normalization, and data splitting strategy.

### Model Architecture
Detail the EfficientNetB5 architecture, including any modifications or custom layers added to tailor the model for skin disease classification.

### Training
Outline the training process, including:
- Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer)
- Hardware specifications (GPU/CPU usage)
- Training time

### Evaluation
Discuss the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, with a focus on the F1 score. Include other metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall if applicable.

## Results
Summarize the model's performance on the test set, providing insights into its accuracy and robustness. Include visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, or example predictions.
